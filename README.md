# Framework-Divide-Conquer
    Framework template for divide and conquer algorithms
## Introduction
### What is divide and conquer?
    Divide and conquer is a technique for solving problems by breaking them into subproblems and then solving each of those subproblems recursively.
### Why is it important?
    Divide and conquer algorithms are often used in computer science to solve problems that are too difficult to solve directly.
### How does it work?
    The divide and conquer algorithm is a recursive algorithm that divides the problem into subproblems and then solves each of those subproblems recursively.
### How does it differ from other algorithms?
    The divide and conquer algorithm is often used in computer science to solve problems that are too difficult to solve directly.
